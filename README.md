# CS 4331 Human Computer Interaction Project 1

# Description
The goal of this project is to find and asses a microwave interface. 

# Getting Started
This is the microwave at my job.

It has a reasonably simple interface, but some of the buttons are either confusing, never used, or both. Also, the handle is a terrible choice in an environment where gloves are used and sanitization is highly prioritized. 

# Use Cases
Common uses:
1) Microwaving small food items for 10 seconds to 1 minute.
Rare uses:
1) Defrosting items
2) Microwaving anything for long periods of time.

The interface actually does a good job of making these actions easy and reasonably intuitive. 

# Sequence of Actions
To microwave something, simply open the microwave by pulling on the handle. Place the food item inside, and then press one of the buttons 1-9 on the interface. The buttons will set the microwave timer to 10, 20, 30 seconds and so on. The microwave will beep when it is finished to let you know that it is finished microwaving.

To defrost an item, simple open the microwave by pulling on the handle. Place the food item inside, and then select the DEFROST button on the interface. Once you have selected DEFROST, you can enter the time in manually. For example, pressing 1, 2 and then 3 will set the microwave timer to 1 minute and 23 seconds. After setting the time, you must press start for the microwave to begin. Admittedly, this is not as intuitive but the explanation is reasonable. When defrosting something, there is a larger range of times that are needed depending on the item. For example, defrosting cookie dough to be reshaped will take about 20 seconds, but defrosting sausage or turkey will take several minutes. Therefore, the "quick-start" function of the buttons that is implemented for simple microwaving isn't as applicable here.

# Feedback
The microwave provides very little feedback. It beeps to let the user know that it is finished microwaving. It expects the user to know that they need to manually enter the time when using the defrost mode. Over all, the feedback is extremely minimal.

# Common Mistakes


# Improvements

# Justification
For this project, I actually polled my coworkers about the microwave since I thought it would be interesting to hear from a group of people who all use the same microwave. I have summarized the statistics below.

When I asked my coworkers if they found our microwave to be confusing to use, every one of them said that they didn't. I provided them with several reasons why they didn't find the microwave confusing to use (they were all presented with the same reasons, so it is consistent). The reasons were:
1) I could tell how to use the microwave just by looking at its interface (meaning the interface is intuitive)
2) I was trained to use this microwave as part of my employee onboarding, so I never had to wonder how to use it
All employees responded that they knew how to use the microwave as a result of their training, so they never had to question its usage. I think that brings up some major points about commercial/industrial microwaves vs residential microwaves.

Commercial microwaves are meant to be used in a restaurant setting. They are more powerful, more efficient, and engineered for speed and heavy usage. Residential microwaves, on the other hand, are less powerful, less efficient, and are not made to be used as heavily as a restaurant microwave would be. I think that the different use cases can absolutely change the way the interface is implemented on the machine. 

This particular commercial microwave's interface isn't necessarily intuitive, but I don't believe that is a large factor in this case. None of the employees had to figure out how to use this microwave on their own, they were trained to do so. Once they were trained how to use it, the simplicity of the interface allowed for very fast, efficient, and worriless use. If we had a microwave with a more complicated interface, we may have to actually think about which button to press which would significantly reduce the speed at which we serve our food. Another factor that goes into this microwave's usage is that everyone using the microwave will be old enough to figure it out by themself _if they had to_. Since 16 is the legal working age, it's not as if a child would have to figure out how to use this microwave.
